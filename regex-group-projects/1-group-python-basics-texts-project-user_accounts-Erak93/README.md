# Python Regex

In this project, we will use **regular expressions**.

The tasks are to be divided between the group members.
One sub-group does [tasks 1 and 2](TASKS_1_2.md). And the other subgroup does [tasks 3 and 4](TASKS_3_4.md).

The [tasks 5, 6 and 7](TASKS_5_6_7.md) are to be done by each member of the group individually.
